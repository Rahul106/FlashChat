# FrontEnd - SignupPage

I am Rahul Rajkumar Gupta. I am currently developing a web/mobile responsive application named FlashChat, 
designed to efficiently chat, group chat, send files, emojis, images and many more upcoming features. 
Leveraging technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome, we have crafted an intuitive frontend, 
including a seamless signup process.
